`void initializeSensors()`
-this method initializes the sensors to have slow sampling with SHT_3, turns the ADC on, enable the 
interrupts, and selects the SMCLK

`int checkRightSensor()`
-this method checks the right sensor and returns the hex value that corresponds to the voltage at the sensor

`int checkLeftSensor()`
-this method checks the left sensor and returns the hex value that corresponds to the voltage at the sensor

`int checkCenterSensor()`
-this method checks the center sensor and returns the hex value that corresponds to the voltage at the sensor
